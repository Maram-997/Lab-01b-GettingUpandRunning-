        <p class="genres"> Pop is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form during the mid-1950s in the United States and the United Kingdom. 
            The terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many disparate styles.</p>
        <li><a href="alternative.html">Alternative Music</a></li>
        <p class="genres"> Alternative rock is a category of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1970s and became widely popular in the 1990s.
             "Alternative" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream or commercial rock or pop music.</p>
        <li><a href="rock.html">Rock and Roll Music</a></li>
<p  class="genres">Rock music also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical, and other musical styles. 
    For instrumentation, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass, drums, and one or more singers</p>
        <li><a href="classic.html">Classical Instrumental Music</a></li>
        <p class="genres"> Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western culture, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music.
